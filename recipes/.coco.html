    <h1>Hot Coco Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../img/coco.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the best hot chocolate you will taste in your whole
            entire life. You will literally not know what to do with your life
            after you have consumed it. Don't even get me started on 
            the marshmallows that can be added. Marshmallows are expensive 
            though and should only be added if you are rich.</p>
